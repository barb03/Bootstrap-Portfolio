                    <p> 
                        I just finished my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Park University.  I really like the web programming classes
                        so that is why I wanted to go to the Coding Boot Camp.  I am hoping to start a career in the web programming area when
                        I finish Coding Boot Camp.   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have three rescue cats.  Vader is the oldest and is all black.  Leia was a feral cat that just did not like being outside, 
                        she will not even go near any of the doors.  Luke is the youngest but the biggest, he weighs 18 pounds and has hopefully 
                        stopped growing.  I like to tell people that I have the Skywalker family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have a few hobbies, like making jewelry and painting but my favorite hobby is racing a vintage race car.  She's a 1964 
                        Formula Vee and this year was the 55th anniversary of the Formula Vee.  She weighs 840 pounds and the top speed is 125mph.  
                        We have a big field of Vees that has been growing so that makes it a lot of fun to race. If 
                        we are all at the race there are 40 of us.
